Usage of this image means that you freely give your consent to running the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing software, which is configured to only run when the Raspberry Pi is powered on and idle. The reason this image includes this software is that the author originally asked for QSL cards for usage of the previous software image. When there were over 8,000 direct downloads of the previous image (plus an unknown number of BitTorrent / indirect downloads) and the author received less than five QSL cards, the author determined the only way to get something in return for all the hard work (non-monetary, mind you) was to code it into the image. The BOINC client will run benign network computing tasks, such as science applications like protein folding, or searching for neutron stars. The author also believes that this rule isn't for "other people" but includes the author as well, and runs the BOINC software on his Raspberry Pi as well. If you don't consent to this, you should stop running and destroy your copy of the image.

We assume no responsibility for errors or omissions in the software or documentation available from its web site. In no event shall we be liable to you or any third parties for any special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind, or any damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, those resulting from loss of use, data or profits, and on any theory of liability, arising out of or in connection with the use of this software.
